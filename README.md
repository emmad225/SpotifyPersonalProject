# Spotify Year-in-Review Analysis; Exploring My Personal Music Listening Trends Using Python and Tableau

Introduction: 
* The aim of this project was to analyze my Spotify listening data over the past year and create insights into my listening habits, favorite artists, genres, and seasonal trends.

Tools Used:
* I used Python (Google Colab) for data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and initial visualizations, then used Tableau to create an interactive dashboard.

Data Collection: 
* I downloaded my Spotify data directly from my account as part of Spotifyâ€™s user data access options. 

Data Preparation: 
* Loaded and cleaned the data using Pandas in Google Colab.

Exploratory Analysis: 
* Performed initial analysis to identify top artists, genres, and song frequency using Python libraries (like Matplotlib and Seaborn).

Dataframes Creation: 
* Created new DataFrames for various analytical needs, including one for daily and monthly listening trends and another for seasonal listening trends.

Visualizations:
* Python Visualizations: Generated visualizations in Google Colab to understand key metrics.
* Tableau Dashboard: Developed an interactive dashboard in Tableau for deeper insights. The dashboard includes filters for exploring data by artist, genre, and monthly trends.

Notable Findings
* My listening of certain artists peaks during certain months, indicating seasonal trends.
* Favorite artists over the year included Taylor Swift, Drake, Nicki Minaj, Tate McRae, and Sabrina Carpenter

Future Work:
* Potential to explore sentiment analysis of lyrics for favorite songs during specific seasons or build predictive models for future listening habits.
